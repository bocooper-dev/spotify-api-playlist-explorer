# Feature Specification: Spotify SDK Integration Migration

**Feature Branch**: `002-replace-current-api`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "replace current api handling with the @spotify/web-api-ts-sdk"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Parsed: Migrate from custom Spotify API implementation to official SDK
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Developers, End users (indirectly affected)
   ‚Üí Actions: Replace, migrate, maintain functionality
   ‚Üí Data: Same playlist and genre data, improved SDK interfaces
   ‚Üí Constraints: Maintain existing functionality and user experience
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Migration should maintain backward compatibility for users
   ‚Üí Performance characteristics of SDK vs custom implementation
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User experience should remain identical
   ‚Üí Developer experience should improve with SDK benefits
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements focused on maintaining existing functionality
   ‚Üí Enhanced error handling and type safety through SDK
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Same entities but with SDK-provided interfaces
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All requirements measurable and testable
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
End users continue to search for Spotify playlists with the same functionality and user experience as before, while the underlying system benefits from improved reliability, better error handling, and enhanced type safety provided by the official Spotify SDK.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user performs a playlist search with existing criteria, **When** the search executes, **Then** the results are identical in format and content to the previous implementation
2. **Given** the system encounters a Spotify API error, **When** the error occurs, **Then** users receive more informative and actionable error messages through improved SDK error handling
3. **Given** a user exports search results to CSV, **When** the export completes, **Then** the file format and content remain exactly the same as before
4. **Given** the system needs to authenticate with Spotify, **When** authentication occurs, **Then** the process is more reliable and handles edge cases better than the custom implementation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the SDK handles rate limiting differently than the custom implementation?
- How does the system maintain the same performance characteristics with the SDK?
- What occurs if the SDK introduces breaking changes in future updates?
- How are authentication token refresh cycles handled by the SDK compared to custom logic?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain identical playlist search functionality and results
- **FR-002**: System MUST preserve existing genre validation and filtering capabilities
- **FR-003**: System MUST continue to support CSV export with the same format and data
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain the same authentication flow for Spotify API access
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide equivalent or better error handling and user feedback
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve caching behavior for genres and authentication tokens
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain the same API response times and performance characteristics
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle rate limiting and retry logic equivalent to or better than current implementation
- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve all existing data validation and transformation logic
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility for all existing API endpoints

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Migration MUST NOT introduce any breaking changes for end users
- **NFR-002**: System MUST maintain or improve current performance benchmarks
- **NFR-003**: Migration MUST enhance code maintainability and type safety
- **NFR-004**: System MUST provide better debugging and error diagnostics than current implementation

### Key Entities
- **Spotify SDK Client**: Official SDK instance that replaces custom HTTP client logic
- **Authentication Handler**: SDK-provided authentication management replacing custom token handling
- **API Response Mapper**: Component that transforms SDK responses to existing internal data formats
- **Error Handler**: Enhanced error processing using SDK-provided error types and information
