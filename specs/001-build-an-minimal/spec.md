## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A music enthusiast wants to discover popular playlists in specific genres that have a significant following, allowing them to find high-quality, well-curated music collections and potentially connect with playlist creators.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I specify "rock" and "jazz" as genres with minimum 1000 followers, **When** I search for playlists, **Then** I receive up to 50 playlists matching these criteria with URLs and owner information
2. **Given** I set a minimum follower count of 5000, **When** I search without specifying genres, **Then** I receive up to 50 popular playlists across all genres with the specified minimum followers
3. **Given** I search for playlists in a very niche genre with high follower requirements, **When** fewer than 50 playlists match the criteria, **Then** I receive all available matching playlists with clear indication of the actual count

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no playlists match the specified genre and follower criteria?
- How does the system handle invalid or non-existent genre names?
- What occurs when the Spotify service is unavailable or rate limits are exceeded?
- How are playlists with unavailable or private owner information handled?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to specify one or more music genres as search criteria
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to set a minimum follower count threshold for playlist filtering
- **FR-003**: System MUST return up to 50 playlists that match the specified genre and follower criteria
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide the Spotify URL for each returned playlist
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide owner contact information for each playlist [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific contact fields required - username, email, profile URL, display name?]
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate with Spotify to access playlist data [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: authentication method - client credentials, user OAuth, or other?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle cases where fewer than 50 playlists match the criteria by returning all available matches
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide user interface for inputting search criteria [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: interface type not specified - web app, CLI, REST API?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate genre names against available Spotify genres
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle API rate limiting and service unavailability gracefully

### Key Entities
- **Playlist**: Represents a Spotify playlist with properties including name, follower count, genre classification, URL, and owner information
- **User/Owner**: Represents the creator of a playlist with contact/profile information available through Spotify
- **Genre**: Music genre categories used for filtering playlists (rock, jazz, pop, etc.)
- **Search Criteria**: User-specified parameters including genre list and minimum follower count
